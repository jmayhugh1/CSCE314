-reason for the difference in output
Each member in the family has a different thread. These multiple threads can cause it to run in an unpredicatble order. This order is affected by 
things out of my control like operating system scheduling. Once the first three messages are sent then the two threads for homer and bart are operating independently, causing homer's message to 
have different placings within barts floods of text.

======================
=====   Part 2   =====
======================

The SimBoc class is meant to represent a messaging system between an sender and recpient. The class uses more than one thread at the same time and it is neccesary to synchronize the 
different message queues because multiple threads might be able to manipulate the message queses at the same time and cause inconsistencies. If a thread is iterating through a message queue and another threads adds or removes elements from it, then the iteration will fail
or it can produce inconsistent behavior. The message queues gave to be synchronized to ensure that the threads can work without causing problems with each other.

 The implementation given doesnt even allow for the possibility of deadlock. The send() and retrieve methods rely on different objects to synchronize. The send() synchonizes with the messages object and retrieve requires the myMessages objecct. Moerover, the run() method syncs 
 the two objects in a nested manner which prevents other threads from accesing messages or myMessages while the iteration and message processing happens. The implementation threads can acess the messages object or the private myMessages object without blocking each other.
